Mode System
===========

Vy implements a mode system. It means that when Vy is on mode 1 and you press 
Control-d then it will perform a different action from when Vy is on mode 2 and
you press Control-d.

Vy can have infinite modes. It means you can make it perform an infinite set of actions
whenever it happens an event like Control-d. So, it is possible to have a lot of new themes,
you can define your own themes(The way of how vy performs actions based on pressing of keys).

Vy has two main modes. The mode 1 and mode 0.
When Vy is on mode 0 you can insert text in the AreaVi that has focus.
When Vy is on mode 1, whenever you press a key Vy will perform an action corresponding to that key.


**It remains to implement the INTRO.**
